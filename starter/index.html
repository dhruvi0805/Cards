                    The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, unified fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical roof. Its core principle — form follows function — demanded that every visual decision serve a purpose. Faculty including Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, and Klee developed a foundation curriculum (Vorkurs) emphasizing geometric abstraction, primary colors, and modular composition. The school's output — from typography to furniture to architecture — established the blueprint for modern design education. When the Nazis closed it in 1933, its diaspora seeded modernist thinking worldwide.

                <p class="card-description">
                    Emerging from Switzerland and Germany, this movement refined Bauhaus principles into a cohesive, global visual language. Led by figures like Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann, the style prioritized objectivity, legibility, and anonymity. It introduced the mathematically constructed grid as a tool for organizing information and championed the use of flush-left, ragged-right sans-serif typography (notably Helvetica and Univers). By removing the designer's personal "signature," the movement sought a universal clarity that could transcend national borders, making it the gold standard for corporate identity and public signage.

            <!-- New Wave Typography Card -->
            <article class="card card-newwave">
                <div class="card-accent"></div>

                <p class="card-dates">1970s–1980s</p>
                <p class="card-description">
                    A direct rebellion against the rigid constraints of the Swiss Style, New Wave (or "Swiss Punk") was pioneered by Wolfgang Weingart at the Basel School of Design. Weingart, though trained in the International Style, began "questioning the grid" by experimenting with letterspacing, layered film, and staggered type. The movement traded clinical objectivity for intuition and visual texture, often featuring complex overlapping elements and varying type weights. It proved that legibility didn't have to be the only goal of design; instead, the emotional and expressive impact of the page became a priority, bridging the gap between modernism and postmodernism.
