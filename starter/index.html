                <p class="card-description">
                    The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, pursued the unity of all arts—the synthesis of fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical vision. Under Gropius's direction, the school rejected decoration in favor of integration: form and function achieved harmony through rigorous, experimental process. The Vorkurs foundation curriculum (developed by Johannes Itten, later refined by Moholy-Nagy and others) taught material exploration, color theory informed by Kandinsky's spirituality, and rational proportion systems rooted in production methods. The school was less a blueprint than a living laboratory—chaotic, political, and radical. Its diaspora after 1933 carried Bauhaus pedagogy and ideals to the Americas and beyond, fundamentally reshaping modern design and architecture.

            <!-- Swiss Style Card -->

                <p class="card-description">
                    Emerging from Switzerland and Germany, this movement refined Bauhaus principles into a cohesive, global visual language. Led by figures like Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann, the style prioritized objectivity, legibility, and anonymity. It introduced the mathematically constructed grid as a tool for organizing information and championed the use of flush-left, ragged-right sans-serif typography (notably Helvetica and Univers). By removing the designer's personal "signature," the movement sought a universal clarity that could transcend national borders, making it the gold standard for corporate identity and public signage.

            <!-- New Wave Typography Card -->

                <div class="card-accent"></div>
                <h2 class="card-title">New Wave Typography</h2>
                <p class="card-dates">1970s–1980s</p>
                <p class="card-description">
                    A direct rebellion against the rigid constraints of the Swiss Style, New Wave (or "Swiss Punk") was pioneered by Wolfgang Weingart at the Basel School of Design. Weingart, though trained in the International Style, began "questioning the grid" by experimenting with letterspacing, layered film, and staggered type. The movement traded clinical objectivity for intuition and visual texture, often featuring complex overlapping elements and varying type weights. It proved that legibility didn't have to be the only goal of design; instead, the emotional and expressive impact of the page became a priority, bridging the gap between modernism and postmodernism.
