                <p class="card-description">
                    The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, pursued the unity of all arts—the synthesis of fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical vision. Under Gropius's direction, the school rejected decoration in favor of integration: form and function achieved harmony through rigorous, experimental process. The Vorkurs foundation curriculum (developed by Johannes Itten, later refined by Moholy-Nagy and others) taught material exploration, color theory informed by Kandinsky's spirituality, and rational proportion systems rooted in production methods. The school was less a blueprint than a living laboratory—chaotic, political, and radical. Its diaspora after 1933 carried Bauhaus pedagogy and ideals to the Americas and beyond, fundamentally reshaping modern design and architecture.

            <!-- Swiss Style Card -->

                <h2 class="card-title">Swiss Style</h2>
                <p class="card-dates">1950s–1970s</p>
                <p class="card-description">
                    Swiss Style emerged from Switzerland's graphic and typographic traditions, synthesizing Bauhaus principles with systematic order to create a new visual language. Led by Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann, the movement prioritized **clarity of communication**—not anonymity. A proportional, systematic grid became the foundational tool, organizing information with rigor derived from content and spatial harmony rather than abstract mathematics. Sans-serif typefaces (Helvetica, Univers) and asymmetric layouts functioned as method, not mere aesthetics. The designer's role was to make structure *visible* and serve the message, not to disappear. By restraining formal language to essentials, Swiss Style established a **universal system** for clear communication that transcended national borders, becoming the standard for corporate identity, public signage, and information design worldwide.

            <!-- New Wave Typography Card -->

                <div class="card-accent"></div>
                <h2 class="card-title">New Wave Typography</h2>
                <p class="card-dates">1970s–1980s</p>
                <p class="card-description">
                    New Wave Typography emerged as a **radical rejection** of Swiss Style's rigid systems. Pioneered by Wolfgang Weingart at the Basel School of Design and amplified globally by designers including Neville Brody and April Greiman, the movement broke the grid—not gently, but with conviction. Layered typography, experimental letterspacing, and staggered, overlapping type weren't questions but declarations. Intuition and emotional truth became *primary*, not secondary to readability. The goal was **visceral communication**—work that struck viewers in the gut, not just the intellect. By the 1990s, designers like David Carson pushed these ideas to their limit on television and in experimental magazines, proving that legibility was a choice, not a commandment. New Wave didn't end in the 1980s; it evolved into a global cultural shift, from punk aesthetics to music videos to digital design, fundamentally challenging the notion that clarity required invisibility.
