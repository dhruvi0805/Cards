## Bauhaus (1919–1933)

The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, unified fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical roof. Its core principle — **form follows function** — demanded that every visual decision serve a purpose. Faculty including Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, and Klee developed a foundation curriculum (Vorkurs) emphasizing geometric abstraction, primary colors, and modular composition. The school's output — from typography to furniture to architecture — established the blueprint for modern design education. When the Nazis closed it in 1933, its diaspora seeded modernist thinking worldwide.

**Not to be confused with:** Art Deco, because while both emerged in the early 20th century, Art Deco embraced ornamentation and luxury, while Bauhaus stripped design to functional essentials.

**Accountability:** I verified the Bauhaus founding dates and Vorkurs curriculum against MoMA's exhibition archives and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's historical essays.

## Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)

Emerging from Switzerland and Germany, this movement refined Bauhaus principles into a cohesive, global visual language. Led by figures like Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann, the style prioritized **objectivity, legibility, and anonymity**. It introduced the mathematically constructed grid as a tool for organizing information and championed the use of flush-left, ragged-right sans-serif typography (notably Helvetica and Univers). By removing the designer's personal "signature," the movement sought a universal clarity that could transcend national borders, making it the gold standard for corporate identity and public signage.

Armin Hofmann — Giselle Poster: https://www.moma.org/collection/works/6775 
**Not to be confused with:** Minimalism, because while both use "less," Swiss Style is a rigorous system specifically for information hierarchy and communication, whereas Minimalism is a broader aesthetic movement across all fine arts.

**Accountability:** I cross-referenced the Swiss Style's shift toward objectivity and the 1959 launch of Neue Grafik through the Basel School of Design's historical records.

## New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)

A direct rebellion against the rigid constraints of the Swiss Style, New Wave (or "Swiss Punk") was pioneered by Wolfgang Weingart at the Basel School of Design. Weingart, though trained in the International Style, began "questioning the grid" by experimenting with letterspacing, layered film, and staggered type. The movement traded clinical objectivity for **intuition and visual texture**, often featuring complex overlapping elements and varying type weights. It proved that legibility didn't have to be the only goal of design; instead, the emotional and expressive impact of the page became a priority, bridging the gap between modernism and postmodernism.

**Not to be confused with:** Grunge Typography, because while New Wave broke the rules of the grid, it maintained a clean, photographic, and often "architectural" precision, whereas Grunge focused on distressed textures, dirt, and "ugly" hand-rendered chaos.

**Accountability:** I confirmed Wolfgang Weingart's role in New Wave typography and his specific use of film layering techniques via the AIGA and the Basel School of Design's faculty history.
