Reflection:
In this assigment I learned how to prompt and challenge AI suggestions. I used the AI to ask me clarifying questions in terms of what the webpage should look like to reduce AI hallucination. In addition to that, when it made suggestions, I dove deeper into it and researched each art style to get a better insight.
